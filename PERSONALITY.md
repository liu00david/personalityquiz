# IRSP Relationship Typology  
*A 4-Letter Framework for Understanding Romantic Preferences*

The **IRSP Typology** is a four-dimension dating-personality system inspired by the structural clarity of MBTI but designed specifically for romantic behavior.  
Each person receives a **4-letter code**, one trait from each of the four dichotomies:

1. **I / R** — Idealist vs Realist  
2. **P / E** — Physical vs Emotional  
3. **S / V** — Social vs Private  
4. **F / C** — Forgiving vs Critical  

This framework helps people understand how they love, connect, express, and handle conflict.
